Dice sets are sets of dice to be rolled.  
Dice sets can be added together.  
Dice sets can have conditions added to them.

    - Pattern: **A**d**X**

    - Pattern: +/- in between dice sets (adds or subtracts the next dice set)
- 5 - Adds 5 to the total roll
    - Pattern: **X** adds **X** to the total roll
    
### Conditions
Conditions alter the results of the rolls in some way.  
Conditions are placed after dice sets and before operations.  
Conditions can be chained together on the same dice set.
